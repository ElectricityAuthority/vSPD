vSPD
====

vectorised Scheduling, Pricing and Dispatch - an audited, mathematical replica of SPD, the
pricing and dispatch engine used in the New Zealand electricity market.

Input GDX files are available daily from www.emi.ea.govt.nz/Wholesale/Datasets/FinalPricing/GDX/ at
ftp://emiftp.ea.govt.nz or from www.emi.ea.govt.nz/Datasets/Wholesale/Final_pricing/GDX.

The Electricity Authority created vSPD using the GAMS software in 2008. Dr Ramu Naidoo was
the original author and, until November 2013, the custodian of vSPD. Tuong Nguyen and Dr Phil Bishop
from the Market Analytics team now maintain the vSPD model.

vSPD was most recently audited in August 2019 - see http://www.emi.ea.govt.nz/Tools/vSPD.
