vSPD
====

Vectorised Scheduling, Pricing and Dispatch (vSPD) - an audited, mathematical replica of SPD,
the pricing and dispatch engine used in the New Zealand electricity market.

Input GDX files are available daily from ..\Datasets\Wholesale\Final_pricing\GDX\ at
ftp://ftp.emi.ea.govt.nz or from www.emi.ea.govt.nz/Datasets/Wholesale/Final_pricing/GDX.

The Electricity Authority created vSPD using the GAMS software in 2008. Dr Ramu Naidoo was
the original author and, until November 2013, the custodian of vSPD. Dr Phil Bishop and Tuong
Nguyen now take care of vSPD. Others at the Electricity Authority also contribute.

vSPD was most recently audited in September 2014 - see http://www.emi.ea.govt.nz/Tools/vSPD.

vSPDrunFile.xlsm is a work-in-progress replacement for vSPDrunFile.xls - the Excel-based user
interface to vSPD. Feel free to use it and if any problems are encountered, please report them
to us. While vSPDrunFile.xlsm works now and should offer greater flexibility and functionality
than vSPDrunFile.xls, we will continue to modify and improve it.
